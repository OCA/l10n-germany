When you go to Invoicing -> Configuration -> Accounting -> Fiscal Positions -> open a record
You will find field "Product Type" in both "Tax Mapping" and "Account Mapping" tabs.

This new field allows you to specify a product type for the account/tax.
This can be use in the case where we have two products "service" and "consumable"
with the same Tax, for example 19%, but we need to mapped them to different account/tax.
