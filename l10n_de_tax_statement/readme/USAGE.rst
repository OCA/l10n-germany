To create a statement you need to:

#. Verify that you have enough permits. You need to belong to the *Show Full Accounting Features* group.
#. Go to the menu: `Invoicing -> Reports > Taxes Balance > German Tax Statement`
#. Create a statement, providing a name and specifying start date and end date
#. Press the Update button to calculate the report: the report lines will be displayed in the tab `Statement`
#. Eventually you have to manually enter the tax base amounts of lines '20', '21', '22', '23', '24','26', '27', '28', '29', '30','32', '33', '34', '35', '36','38', '39', '40', '41', '42','48', '49', '50', '51', '52','64', '65', '67') if you want to change the values from float format to integer (in Edit mode, click on the amount of the line to be able to change the value).
#. Press the Post button to set the status of the statement to Posted; the statements set to this state cannot be modified

To add past undeclared invoices:

#. Open the tab `Past Undeclared Invoices`, available when the statement is in status Draft.
#. Set an initial date (field From Date) from which the past undeclared invoices will be displayed.
#. One by one, add the displayed undeclared invoices, by clicking on the `Add Invoice` button present in each line.
#. Press the Update button in order to recompute the statement lines.

Extra info about the workflow:

#. If you need to recalculate or modify or delete a statement already set to Posted status you need first to set it back to Draft status: press the button Reset to Draft
#. Instead, if you send the statement to the Tax Authority, you may want to avoid that the statement is set back to Draft: to avoid this, press the button Final. If you then confirm, it will be not possible to modify this Statement or reset it back to draft anymore.

Printing a PDF report:

#. If you need to print the report in PDF, open a statement form and click: `Print -> German Tax Statement`
