This module extends the *German VAT Statement* module (Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung), by adding the statement for the *Intra-Community transactions declaration* (Zusammenfassende Meldung).

This report is based on the line *Steuerfr. Umsätze mit Vorsteuerabz. innerg. Lieferungen (§4 Nr. 1b) an Abnehmer mit USt-ID (41)* and *Nicht steuerb. sonst. Leist. gem. § 18b S. 1 Nr. 2 (21)* of the German VAT Statement report.
The period is also the same as the one selected in the VAT statement report.

This additional VAT declaration report includes:

* the VAT identification numbers of your customers
* the total amount of intra-Community supplies from Germany for every customer during the selected period
* The values for product deliveries and services are separated in two columns.
* If you want to transmit the values to the official report form, f.e. by "www.elster.de" you would have to enter two lines if both columns product + services contains values.
